/**
In this lecture 
I am gonna show you
how to get information
of the current Operating System

Node documentation
if you scroll down
you can see this 'OS' module
lets take a quick look here.
These are the methods
that are available in this module

for example we have

'os.freemen()'

which returns the amount of free memory
iin this machine
we have total mem

'os.totalmen()'

which is total memory
we can get information
of the current user

'os.userInfo([options])'

we can the uptime of this machine

'os.uptime()'

So lets use a couple of these methods
so if you scroll down.
This is how we load 
this OS module

const os = require('os')

just like loading other modules
we call the 'require' function
and store the result in a constant
called 'os' or anything
